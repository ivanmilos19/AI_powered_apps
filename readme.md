# AI Theme Park Apps

This project hosts two AI-powered apps:

- **Chatbot** – simulates a theme park customer service assistant.
- **Reviews & Summarizer** – displays visitor reviews and generates quick AI summaries of them.

## Setup

### Backend
Install Python dependencies while in the server directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Frontend

All required Bun files are included, so no global installation is needed. You just need Node.js and TypeScript to run the frontend:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
